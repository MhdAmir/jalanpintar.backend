## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Affiliate Leaderboard API

A new authenticated endpoint is available to let partners see how they stack up and to retrieve their personal ranking in one request.

-   **Endpoint**: `GET /api/affiliates/leaderboard`
-   **Query Parameters**
    -   `form_id` (optional, UUID): limit the ranking to a specific form.
    -   `metric` (optional): `total_earned` (default) or `total_referrals`.
    -   `per_page` (optional): page size between 1 and 100.
-   **Response**
    -   `data.leaderboard`: paginated entries sorted by the chosen metric, each with `rank`, `user`, totals, and active affiliate-count.
    -   `data.my_rank`: your aggregate position among all approved affiliates (null when you have no approved records).
    -   `data.my_summary`: quick totals for your approved affiliates within the current filter scope.
    -   `meta`: pagination info plus `total_participants`.

Use this endpoint after authenticating via JWT; it shares the same protections as other affiliate APIs.

    ### Affiliate signup controls

    - New affiliate slots can now **only** be created from the admin side via `POST /api/admin/affiliates`. Admins must specify the `user_id`, target `form_id`, and commission scheme; regular users can no longer submit self-serve requests.
    - The rest of the authenticated affiliate routes (statistics, leaderboard, etc.) remain throttled at `throttle:10,1` to prevent automated scraping/abuse.
    - Manual approval is still required (`pending` → `approved`), so even admin-created slots won’t go live until explicitly approved.
